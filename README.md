# Generative AI Hackathon with Opper

Get together with the Opper community and build with LLMs, free access to tokens from a lot of different models ([Model list](https://docs.opper.ai/functions/models)), RAG, few shot prompting and other techniques to build with quality. Learn and share with friends and colleagues and win some nice swag ;)

## Why do a Hackathon with Opper?
A hackathon with Opper is a great way to experience building LLMs. As many of you have undoubtly have heard, it's quite easy to make a demo with LLMs but trying to build something that can become geared towards production grade, is quite tricky indeed. Opper is a platform that integrates the necessary tools in a single toolbox that enables you to build for production.

## What is Opper?
Opper ([opper.ai](https://opper.ai)) is an integrated platform to build production grade generative AI features, chatbots, and agents. 

- Build structured, model independent LLM calls. Interact with frontier, open-source, and multimodal models using a unified, structured syntax. We empower you to instruct models as code, and reduce the need for complex prompts. 

- Integrate your own data and knowledge. Opper enables both indexing and retrieval of the semantically relevant parts of data and connect it to calls, while you retain full integration control.

- Trace every call and session for full visibility. Track every AI interaction: view sessions, calls, outputs, feedback, reasoning, and costs as easy to understand real-time traces.

- Optimize quality, security, cost and speed in production. Automate LLM tuning with Opper Functions. Optimal models and configs, identified through continuous evaluations and feedback.

- Build from a secure, compliant and European foundation. Opper is built for compliance: GDPR, SOC2, DORA, and EU-ready. Focus on value while we handle regulations.

### Resources
Go to [docs.opper.ai](docs.opper.ai) for all documentation and links to our repos and open sourced projects.

Go to [opper.ai](opper.ai) to get a general idea of what Opper is and take a glance at what others are building with Opper.

You can use Opper's API ([HTTP API Reference](https://api.opper.ai/docs)) or one of the SDKs:
- Python: pip install opperai ([Git repo](https://github.com/opper-ai/opper-python))
- Typescript: npm install opperai ([Git repo](https://github.com/opper-ai/opper-node))

## Joining In
This hackathon is an on site hackathon. We do offer online hackathons as well, be on the lookout for these.

## RVSP to the event
If you are invited to this hackathon, please RSVP so that we can plan accordingly.

We tend to keep our hackathons to 4 hours. Generally, this boils down to 15-30min to get started in teams or individually, build for 3 hours and then 30 mins for show n tell and declare the "winner" :)

### Before the hackathon
Please make sure you have created your Opper account [here](https://platform.opper.ai/auth/signin), logged in and followed the instructions to generate your first call. You might want to get an Opper SDK as well (Python pip install opperai / Typescript npm install opperai). This will ensure that everything works smoothly when we begin the hackathon.

We've compiled examples below (see table) that includes elements of RAG, few shot prompting etc so get you started and inspire you. 

Before the hackathon, please take a look an take note of an example you want to build from. This will help you divide into teams that want to build on the same.

### During the hackathon
In case you don’t want to build from the examples below, feel free to create your own hack. But please, have this prepared in beforehand so that we don't spend the hack time to try to come up with an idea ;)

### After the hackathon
Show and tell together, let’s share learning and challenges. The best hack wins some cool swag ;)

## Examples to get you started
We’ve compiled some example projects to get you started. Feel free to pick any one of them and go ahead. Please read below to get some info on focus areas.
