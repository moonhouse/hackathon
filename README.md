## Why do a Hackathon with Opper?

## What is Opper?
Opper is an integrated platform to build production grade generative AI features, chatbots, and agents. 

### Build
Build structured, model independent LLM calls. Interact with frontier, open-source, and multimodal models using a unified, structured syntax. We empower you to instruct models as code, and reduce the need for complex prompts. 

### Integrate
Integrate your own data and knowledge. Opper enables both indexing and retrieval of the semantically relevant parts of data and connect it to calls, while you retain full integration control.

### Observe
Trace every call and session for full visibility. Track every AI interaction: view sessions, calls, outputs, feedback, reasoning, and costs as easy to understand real-time traces.

### Optimize
Optimize quality, security, cost and speed in production. Automate LLM tuning with Opper Functions. Optimal models and configs, identified through continuous evaluations and feedback.

### Comply
Build from a secure, compliant and European foundation. Opper is built for compliance: GDPR, SOC2, DORA, and EU-ready. Focus on value while we handle regulations.

## Joining In
This hackathon is an on site hackathon. We do offer online hackathons as well, be on the lookout for these.
