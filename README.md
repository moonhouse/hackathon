# Generative AI Hackathon with Opper

Get together with the Opper community and build with LLMs, free access to tokens from a lot of different models ([Model list](https://docs.opper.ai/functions/models)), RAG, few shot prompting and other techniques to build with quality. Learn and share with friends and colleagues and win some nice swag ;)

## Why do a Hackathon with Opper?
A hackathon with Opper is a great way to experience building LLMs. As many of you have undoubtly have heard, it's quite easy to make a demo with LLMs but trying to build something that can become geared towards production grade, is quite tricky indeed. Opper is a platform that integrates the necessary tools in a single toolbox that enables you to build for production.

## What is Opper?
Opper ([opper.ai](https://opper.ai)) is an integrated platform to build production grade generative AI features, chatbots, and agents. 

- Build structured, model independent LLM calls. Interact with frontier, open-source, and multimodal models using a unified, structured syntax. We empower you to instruct models as code, and reduce the need for complex prompts. 

- Integrate your own data and knowledge. Opper enables both indexing and retrieval of the semantically relevant parts of data and connect it to calls, while you retain full integration control.

- Trace every call and session for full visibility. Track every AI interaction: view sessions, calls, outputs, feedback, reasoning, and costs as easy to understand real-time traces.

- Optimize quality, security, cost and speed in production. Automate LLM tuning with Opper Functions. Optimal models and configs, identified through continuous evaluations and feedback.

- Build from a secure, compliant and European foundation. Opper is built for compliance: GDPR, SOC2, DORA, and EU-ready. Focus on value while we handle regulations.

## Hackathon Format
This is an on site hackathon. We do offer online hackathons as well, be on the lookout for these.

### RVSP to the event
If you are invited to this hackathon, please RSVP so that we can plan accordingly.

### Duration
We tend to keep our hackathons to 4 hours. Generally, this boils down to:
- 30 mins intro and to get started in teams or individually
- Build for 3 hours
- 30 mins for show n tell and declare "a winner"

### Before the hackathon
To be efficient with the time we have, please go through this checklist before the hackathon:
1. Create your Opper account [here](https://platform.opper.ai/auth/signin) (it's free for the Hackathon, don't worry)
3. Login and follow the instructions to generate your first call.
4. Decide if you want to use the HTTP API, Python SDK (pip install opperai) or Typescript SDK (npm install opperai).
5. We've compiled examples below (see table) that includes elements of RAG, few shot prompting etc so get you started and inspire you. Before the hackathon, please take a look an take note of an example you want to build from. This will help you divide into teams that want to build on the same.
6. Opper team is here to assist. During the hackathon, there will be engineers from Opper available to assist you in person but also in our Discord [Community Community](https://discord.gg/N3RjGG7PBb). Join it now, so that you can reach out during the Hackathon.

### During the hackathon
In case you don’t want to build from the examples below, feel free to create your own hack. But please, have this prepared in beforehand so that we don't spend the hack time to try to come up with an idea ;)



### After the hackathon
Show and tell together, let’s share learning and challenges. 

We vote with the raise of hands. The best hack wins some cool swag ;)

## Examples to get you started
We’ve compiled some example projects to get you started. Feel free to pick any one of them and go ahead. Please read below to get some info on focus areas.
